 - Write semantics are bounded: “accepted vs confirmed” with time-bounded polling.
 - Session context is keyed by `X-Session-Id` (HTTP) to support follow-ups.

 - `app.py` — MCP tool surface, validation, guardrails, transport glue.
+- `app.py` (`c4_tv_watch_by_name_tool`) — room-scoped TV Watch source resolution and command-based fallback when room video devices are empty.
 - `control4_gateway.py` — async orchestration: timeouts, caching, confirmations, driver quirks.
 - `session_memory.py` — session-scoped memory and “last” helpers for lights + TV/media follow-ups.
 - `tools/run_e2e.py` — fast regression runner (HTTP + STDIO coverage).

+**Objective D — Enable “typical MCP” refactor safely (docs-first)**
+
+- Define target module boundaries (domain tool modules + transport wiring) without changing any existing tool names/args.
+- Acceptance: `GET /mcp/list` output remains stable (same tool names + arg schemas), and e2e scripts still pass.
+- Start from current known-good HEAD; only rewind to an older commit if you have a specific regression you’re escaping.
+- Before refactor code changes: create a baseline tag/branch (e.g., `refactor-baseline-2026-01-26`) for quick rollback and diffing.
+- Refactor in small, testable slices; run `tools/run_e2e.py` after each slice.

 ## Guardrails (from conventions)
 
 - Preserve layering; never call Director/pyControl4 from `app.py`.

 - Never commit secrets; `config.json` is local-only and gitignored.
 - Keep all writes safe-by-default and time-bounded; prefer dry-run where appropriate.
 - Preserve tool names/signatures; contracts evolve by addition.
+- Refactor direction: move toward a more “typical MCP” layout (domain tool modules, smaller files) without breaking tool contracts.
